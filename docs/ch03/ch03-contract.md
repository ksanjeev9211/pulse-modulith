## 1. Chapter Goal

- Establish a repeatable design process independent of problem domain.
- Shift focus from “having the right answer” to demonstrating structured reasoning.
- Make design progression intentional, staged, and communicable.

---

## 2. Primary Pressure Introduced

- Ambiguity pressure:
  - unclear requirements
  - incomplete information
  - open-ended problem space
- A system cannot be designed correctly until ambiguity is reduced.
- Premature decisions amplify misunderstanding.

---

## 3. What the Reader Must Observe or Feel

- Uncertainty is normal and expected at the start.
- Asking questions is a design action, not a delay.
- Structure creates progress even without full information.
- Confidence comes from process clarity, not solution certainty.
- The design conversation matters as much as the design itself.

---

## 4. What Must NOT Be Introduced Yet

- No optimization discussions.
- No deep dives without agreement on scope.
- No premature component selection.
- No unstated assumptions.
- No silent thinking.

Any design step taken without shared understanding violates this chapter’s intent.

---

## 5. Expected Mental Shift at Chapter End

From:
- “I must design the system.”

To:
- “I must guide the design process.”

The reader must internalize:
- design is collaborative
- design is iterative
- design quality is measured by clarity of reasoning, not completeness

---

## 6. Guardrails for Implementation Exercises

- Always begin by defining scope explicitly.
- Progress in deliberate stages.
- Pause for alignment before deepening design.
- Treat feedback as design input, not correction.
- Stop when the process is clear, not when the system is complete.

If the exercise results in a finished architecture, it has gone too far.
