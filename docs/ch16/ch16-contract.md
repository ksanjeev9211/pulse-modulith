## 1. Chapter Goal

- Establish continuous learning as a permanent system design requirement.
- Reinforce that no architecture is ever final.
- Frame system design as an evolving discipline, not a checklist.

---

## 2. Primary Pressure Introduced

- Change pressure:
    - new requirements
    - shifting scale
    - evolving user behavior
- Systems decay if learning stops.

---

## 3. What the Reader Must Observe or Feel

- Design skills compound through iteration.
- Past solutions eventually become constraints.
- Good systems invite revision.
- Mastery comes from pattern recognition, not memorization.
- The reader should feel responsibility for continued growth.

---

## 4. What Must NOT Be Introduced Yet

- No claim of architectural completeness.
- No “final best practices.”
- No fixed system templates.
- No static design rules.
- No illusion of mastery.

If the reader believes the journey is complete, this chapter has failed.

---

## 5. Expected Mental Shift at Chapter End

From:
- “I learned system design.”

To:
- “I am learning system design.”

The reader must internalize:
- design evolves
- context changes
- judgment improves with experience

---

## 6. Guardrails for Implementation Exercises

- Revisit earlier designs periodically.
- Question prior assumptions.
- Track tradeoffs explicitly over time.
- Compare multiple designs for the same problem.
- Stop when reflection becomes more valuable than construction.

If the exercise focuses on building more systems instead of refining thinking, it exceeds this chapter’s intent.
